I build web applications using React, Node.js, Python, and other modern technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems and creating solutions that make a difference.

When I'm not coding, I like to:

**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Python

## My Approach

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building applications that solve real problems. I focus on creating user-friendly interfaces backed by robust, scalable systems.
